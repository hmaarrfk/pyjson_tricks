# Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! Bug reports, feature suggestions and
code contributions help this project become more useful for everyone!

Contributing can be done through:

* Reporting bugs ([issues](https://github.com/mverleg/pyjson_tricks/issues))
* Suggesting features ([issues](https://github.com/mverleg/pyjson_tricks/issues))
* Fixing bugs ([pull request](https://github.com/mverleg/pyjson_tricks/pulls))
* Implementing features ([pull request](https://github.com/mverleg/pyjson_tricks/pulls))
* Reviewing a [pull request](https://github.com/mverleg/pyjson_tricks/pulls)
* Telling a friend :) 

There are only few things to keep in mind:

* Your contributions become [BSD-licensed](https://github.com/mverleg/pyjson_tricks/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)
* Discuss features in an issue before contributing code.
* Automated tests are required to go live, not necessarily to commit.
* Try to follow the [code conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
* [Be nice](https://github.com/mverleg/pyjson_tricks/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst).

Feel free to add yourself in the README if you send a pull request!
Either at the specific feature ("thanks to NAME"), or in "Usage &
contributions".
